# Decathlon-React-App


## Structure of The Application
I designed a 3 page screen. These screens have a unique design.I pulled the API ends so that they can be seen on the relevant screens. I wrote the Component Tests of the relevant pages.Then I installed docker. The purpose of installing Docker is to enable you to open the project more easily. Because it is in a virtual machine, our versions will be consistent.


## Technologies That I Used

-- Development --

React JS (Node v16.13.2)
Docker\
Github\

-- Testing --

React Testing Library (Component Test)

## Scripts That You Can use

npm start: To run the application <br/>
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name react-frontend-dev frontend-app-dev: A block prepared to run Docker <br/>
npm run test : Component Test <br/>
